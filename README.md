# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website! This project showcases my work, skills, and experience in a modern and interactive way.

## Design & Development

I've developed the Figma design myself, leveraging my design skills inherited from my architecture background. This unique perspective allows me to create visually appealing and functional user interfaces that balance aesthetics with usability.
